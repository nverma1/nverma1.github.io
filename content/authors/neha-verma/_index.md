I am a second-year Computer Science Ph.D. Student at the [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University, supervised by [Kevin Duh](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~kevinduh/) and [Kenton Murray](https://kentonmurray.com/).   

Previously, I was at Yale University studying math and computer science, and working with [Dragomir Radev](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev/) at the [Yale LILY Lab](https://yale-lily.github.io/).
